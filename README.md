# Machine Learning Reference: Concept to Code

A structured repository dedicated to deconstructing Machine Learning models into four fundamental layers. This project serves as a technical bridge between mathematical theory and production-ready implementation.

---

## 🏗 Framework
Every algorithm in this repository is processed through a consistent 4-step pipeline:

1.  **Intuition:** Conceptual overview and logic without the jargon.
2.  **Mathematics:** Formal derivation of the objective functions, gradients, and optimization.
3.  **Implementation:** * *From Scratch:* Pure NumPy implementation of the math.
    * *Standard:* Practical application using Scikit-Learn/PyTorch.
4.  **Visualization:** Geometric interpretation of model behavior and data boundaries.
